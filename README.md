# Vdwn

Simple bash script to download youtube and instagram videos

That's my first time writing any script ever, so i wrote it as a challenge to test bash knowledge.

As of now it won't run with gitbash, only Powershell and WSL distros. 

# Requirements

- Any shell able to read .sh files
- yt-dlp package 

# Usage 

- Update/upgrade your OS 
- Clone the repo to your preferred directory with git clone https://github.com/DankAlighieri/Vdwn 
- If missing, download and install yt-dlp from: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
- Run vdwn.sh on your shell
- Follow the steps on the prompt
- Done!

# Optional 

You can change the download directory by editing the first line on the script.
